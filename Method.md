#### RECIPE

**Method**

·    In a blender take 1 tbsp instant coffee, 3 to 4 tbsp sugar, add ¼        cup warm water.

·    Stir very well. To make the shake, I used full cream milk. You can also use skimmed milk or low fat milk. If using skimmed milk or low fat milk, then just reduce the ¼ cup water to about 2 to 3 tbsp.

·    Blend for a minute or till the coffee solution becomes frothy and the color lightens a bit.

·    Add 6 to 7 ice cubes. For a thick cold coffee, you can reduce the ice cubes from 2 to 4.

·    Pour 2 cups chilled milk.

·    Blend once more till everything is mixed well and you get a nice froth on top.

·    Pour in glasses and serve cold coffee. The froth on top settles down and reduces with time. So serve immediately.
